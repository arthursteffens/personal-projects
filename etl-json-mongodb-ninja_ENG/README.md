<!-- Loading data from JSON files into MongoDB.

## Details
In this project, I was presented with a dataset of over 250k JSON files. The files come from a NFT (Non-fungible tokens) project, a blockchain technology that has been talking a lot lately. The NFT project proposes a collection of more than 1000 unique characters, the ninja Johnny in various situations.

However, I used the complete combination generated by the team, which contains 256,093 different characters, one in each JSON file containing the name and characteristics. It is difficult to analyze the data with this high amount of files. So using Python I loaded all the data into a document-oriented NoSQL database, MongoDB, and I made a simple dashboard in PowerBI to filter the character by its characteristics.

## Usage
To properly run this script, you'll need Python and Docker.

- Install required python packages: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Run ```docker-compose up -d```. This will run a MongoDB instance in a docker container.
- Run the main script: ```python main.py``` -->
